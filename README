This an addon patch for lemm's V2 tilesets patch for "Commander Keen in 
Invasion of the Vorticons." It add the ability for the game to use palettes 
stored in the tileset files generated by TilesetTool. It also enables smooth 
fades, custom lights-out colors (Row 2 of the palette in TilesetTool), and 
color cycling (uses each row of the tileset palette in turn, not compatible
with lightswitches). Do not use any other palette or fading patches with this,  
there will be conflicts and most functionality is already provided. 

To use, add the loader.BIN and vga.BIN to your v2 project (overwriting the 
original v2 loader.BIN), and add the section of keen1.pat under the "VGA" 
header to your patch file.

For patchers/hackers: this patch is set up to assemble with JWASM and GNU Make 
on Linux. The source files for the binaries are in patch/source. Build by 
running `make` in the epsiode directory. If you add the files for Keen and V2 
(making sure to use the included loader and not the original V2 one), 
`make run` will launch Dosbox after building. `make-debug` will launch 
"dosbox-debug" if you have built Dosbox with the debugger under that name.
